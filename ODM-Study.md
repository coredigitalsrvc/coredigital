# ODM Study and Reference

## Flags

### gps-accuracy
When using RTK/PPK set gps-accuracy flag to either .1m or 2x the expected vertical accuracy (i.e. .05' ft = .015m and doubled is .03m).

.1m is a measurement thrown around the ODM forums when using RTK. 2x the expected vertical is from one of the maintainers of ODM but other anecdotes say tightening this up too much can cause some issues.
